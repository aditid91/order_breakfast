# Simple Program for ordering breakfast

To build this program, there are follwing things to do:
1) Get input and use it to determine what happens next
2) Handle bad input without crashing
3) Be flexible with the input the user can enter
4) Print messages to the console, with a short pause after each one
5) Allow the player to order again if they like

The code has many files where many changes have been made in each file and the final code is the "Refactored code" i.e. its made simpler, better prganized, more readable, and easier to maintain.
